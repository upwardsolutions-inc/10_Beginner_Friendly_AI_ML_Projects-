# Instructions to Load and Use the Jupyter Notebook

This README provides step-by-step instructions for running the Jupyter Notebook script (`Student_Grades_Prediction.ipynb`) and using the test data (`student_grades.csv`).

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook using the command:
  ```
  pip install notebook
  ```
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following libraries before running the notebook:
  ```
  pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
  ```

## Files Included
1. **`student_grades_dataset.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model.
2. **`Chapter_1_Student_Grades_Prediction.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
3. **`README.md`**: This file with usage instructions.

## Steps to Use the Notebook

### 1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
- Navigate to the directory containing the files.
- Launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal or command prompt:
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Open the file `Student_Grades_Prediction.ipynb` in your browser.

### 2. Load the Dataset
- Ensure the file `student_grades.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
- The notebook script automatically loads this file. You can modify the file path if required.

### 3. Run the Notebook
- Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to:
  1. Load and explore the dataset.
  2. Visualize the relationships between features.
  3. Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
  4. Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  5. Predict grades for new data.

### 4. Test the Model
- The notebook includes an example to predict a grade for a student who studied 7 hours and had 85% attendance. 
- Modify the input features in the prediction cell to test different scenarios.

### 5. Troubleshooting
- If the notebook fails to load the dataset, check that the `student_grades_dataset.csv` file exists in the correct directory.
- Ensure all required libraries are installed.

## Additional Notes
- This notebook is designed for beginners to learn the basics of linear regression and data preprocessing.
- Feel free to expand the dataset or customize the notebook for more complex use cases.
